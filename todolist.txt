1. allow for passes
2. create list that keeps track of number of exits for each player
3. come up and implement various eval tactics
4. change action() to work with maxn


-distance- maximum of 7
-num pieces (4, 5, 6 optimal, minimum of 0, max of 12)
-num exits minimum 0, max of 4/

if we have less pieces than we need to win, then aim for other pieces/don't try to exit/reduce weighting of distance.
if we are the last ones left, then increase weighting of distance, decrease weighting of numpieces and exits
if another player is close to winning (i.e. 3 exits), and we are not, then get defensive.
if we are close to winning, try to exit everything asap.
